## Contributing

> State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
> For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation
> on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables
> that they need to set. Make these steps explicit.
> These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
> You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests.
> These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
> inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful
> if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
